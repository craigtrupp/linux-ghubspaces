Part 1: Search with find
 - Search the filesystem for CSV files: find -name "*.csv"
 - Search the filesystem for .txt files: find -name "*.txt"

# Bash Terminal Output
@craigtrupp ➜ .../linux-ghubspaces/deng_duke/closing-week-items/SearchCommands (main) $ find -name "*.csv"
@craigtrupp ➜ .../linux-ghubspaces/deng_duke/closing-week-items/SearchCommands (main) $ find -name "*.txt"
./barDIR/biz.txt
./fooDIR/bam.txt

- Pretty simple here just a wildcard search for the end of the file at the root
folder level that shows we only have .txt type files for the find command



Part 2: Search with find, xargs and grep - Reference Markdown for Prompts
# Bash Terminal Output
@craigtrupp ➜ .../linux-ghubspaces/deng_duke/closing-week-items/SearchCommands (main) $ find -name "*.txt" | xargs grep Apple 
./barDIR/biz.txt:Apple
@craigtrupp ➜ .../linux-ghubspaces/deng_duke/closing-week-items/SearchCommands (main) $ grep -R Banana 
README.md:3.  Run the following command:  `grep -R Banana .`
fooDIR/bam.txt:Banana
@craigtrupp ➜ .../linux-ghubspaces/deng_duke/closing-week-items/SearchCommands (main) $ grep -R Banana .
./README.md:3.  Run the following command:  `grep -R Banana .`
./fooDIR/bam.txt:Banana

It loos like in part 2 we are using the pipe comand for search every file (-name flage) at the current directory
and using the regex like grep to find Apple which we can see on the output is in the barDir/biz.txt and gives us the value

The second part is what appears a similar search in a different fashion for finding Banana at that root file where the Bash command went

After timing each, it seems like a fairly minimal tradeoff timewise but we do have a fairly tiny sample here
